This repository was created as part of my learning how to simulate dynamical systems. I believe once I'm confident in using `scipy` to simulate dynamical systems two things will happen 

1. I will have gained intuition into how dynamical systems behave/a deeper grasp of the concepts involved and how equations can be manipulated to produce new dynamics
2. The power to simulate dynamical systems will enable me to experiment as I read the textbook on dynamical systems and chaos. I believe experimentation is the key to actually understanding something because it forces you to self-validate your hypotheses and is the same pipeline real scientists and mathematicians use to create new ideas. Additionally, in the first stages of learning complex concepts actively (through play and experimentations), you are forced to distill the complex concepts into their purest essence â€“ and hereby you make them yours. 


I'd also like to point out that what I am capable of doing can be described by the equation `f x = x^2` (I could also describe the whole system of learning as a dynamical system). At the beginning, things are new and you don't really have experience dealing with such complexity. As time passes and you do more reading, and the ideas start to marinate in your mind, new structure and understanding is created. Then, you begin to see connections and start to form hypotheses, questions, and more nuanced observations. The more things you learn, the more connections exist and the more experienced you are. Finally, you hit the singularity point and reach polynomial growth. I'm currently hitting this point, where everything I've learned is coming together and I finally start creating something of my own, and that is all because of the tutorial I'm following. 

I become a power dynamical systems modeller and I become more powerful in general. So, let's go model dynamical systems!
